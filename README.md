# ========
# ### A Toolbox for Curating Scientific Knowledge Extracted from Scientific Publications
# #### Tool development for the Curate Science website
# 
# *Very BETA version - [Fred Hasselman](http://fredhasselman.com)*
# 
# All the functions that are required are available in `scicuRe_source.R`, a package will follow soon. 
# Use the code below to source it directly from GitHub (the source function was found [here](http://tonybreyal.wordpress.com/2011/11/24/source_https-sourcing-an-r-script-from-github/)). It requires you to install and load the `RCurl` package
# 
# ```
# source_https <- function(url, ...) {
#   # load the package 
#   require(RCurl)
# 
#   # parse and evaluate each .R script
#   sapply(c(url, ...), function(u) {
#     eval(parse(text = getURL(u, followlocation = TRUE, cainfo = system.file("CurlSSL", "cacert.pem", package = "RCurl"))), envir = .GlobalEnv)
#   })
# }
# 
# # Source the scicuRe_source.R toolbox!
# source_https("https://raw.github.com/FredHasselman/SC-stats/master/scicuRe_source.R")
# ```
# 
# **SEARCH STRATEGY**
# 
#  - Need stats labelled for each experiment in a multi-experiment study
#  - Need measures of effect size
#  - Need aggregate stats, i.e. based on post-hoc power and more
#  - Need information to decide if proper analysis was used on stats ([`statcheck`](https://github.com/MicheleNuijten/statcheck) provides some interesting tests!)
#     
# *Therefore:*    
#  - Search is implemented to be driven by the hierarchical structure of an empirical report
#  - Structure is: Header (e.g., Experiment 1) -> Section (e.g., Results) -> [Table 1. ->] *STAT OF INTEREST* <- Page number [<- Appendix]
#  - Extract as much information as possible!
#     
# The `statcheck` package bij M. Nuijten is available [here](https://github.com/MicheleNuijten/statcheck)   
# Download, unzip and install, e.g. by running:    
# ```
# install.packages("~/Downloads/statcheck-master/", repos = NULL, type="source")
# ```   
# 
# The authors of `statcheck` note:   
# > The `pdftotext` program (http://www.foolabs.com/xpdf/download.html) is used to convert PDF files to plain text files. This must be installed and PATH variables must be properly set so that this program can be used from command line.
#    
# For the code in this package to execute correctly `pdftotxt` and `pdfinfo` need to be available on your system as well.   
# Check it now:
# ```
# if(all(file.exists(Sys.which("pdftotext")))) print("YES!") else print("NO!")
# ```
