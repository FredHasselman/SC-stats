It requires you to install and load the `RCurl` package\r\n\r\n```\r\nsource_https <- function(url, ...) {\r\n  # load the package \r\n  require(RCurl)\r\n\r\n  # parse and evaluate each .R script\r\n  sapply(c(url, ...), function(u) {\r\n    eval(parse(text = getURL(u, followlocation = TRUE, cainfo = system.file(\"CurlSSL\", \"cacert.pem\", package = \"RCurl\"))), envir = .GlobalEnv)\r\n  })\r\n}\r\n\r\n# Source the scicuRe_source.R toolbox!\r\nsource_https(\"https://raw.github.com/FredHasselman/SC-stats/master/scicuRe_source.R\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n**SEARCH STRATEGY**\r\n\r\n - Need stats labelled for each experiment in a multi-experiment study\r\n - Need measures of effect size\r\n - Need aggregate stats, i.e. based on post-hoc power and more\r\n - Need information to decide if proper analysis was used on stats ([`statcheck`](https://github.com/MicheleNuijten/statcheck) provides some interesting tests!)\r\n    \r\n*Therefore:*    \r\n - Search is implemented to be driven by the hierarchical structure of an empirical report\r\n - Structure is: Header (e.g., Experiment 1) -> Section (e.g., Results) -> [Table 1. ->] *STAT OF INTEREST* <- Page number [<- Appendix]\r\n - Extract as much information as possible!\r\n    \r\nThe `statcheck` package bij M. Nuijten is available [here](https://github.com/MicheleNuijten/statcheck)   \r\nDownload, unzip and install, e.g. by running:    \r\n```\r\ninstall.packages(\"~/Downloads/statcheck-master/\", repos = NULL, type=\"source\")\r\n```   \r\n\r\nThe authors of `statcheck` note:   \r\n> The `pdftotext` program (http://www.foolabs.com/xpdf/download.html) is used to convert PDF files to plain text files. This must be installed and PATH variables must be properly set so that this program can be used from command line.\r\n   \r\nFor the code in this package to execute correctly `pdftotxt` and `pdfinfo` need to be available on your system as well.   \r\nCheck it now:\r\n```\r\nif(all(file.exists(Sys.which(\"pdftotext\")))) print(\"YES!\") else print(\"NO!\")\r\n```   \r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
